## Old Exercises
- Web App - Creating a web app that returns a simple message
- Blob Storage - Host a static site using Azure Blob Storage

## New Exercises

### ARM Templates
Set up a template that creates at least 3 distinct resources. Send me the infrastructure code/template

### Azure VM
Spin up a VM and deploy some web-based application within that instance and then send me a link so that I can access it. 
All we did in class was set up a VM so the web application portion of this is new so might need to do some extra research. 

### Azure Function App
Set up a function app, deploy some code and send me the link. 

### Terraform
Use Terraform to create at least 3 resources and send me the code. IF you get stumped, do research and ask around and ask me.
