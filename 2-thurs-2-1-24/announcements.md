## The Plan for Today
1. Ensure everyone has access to Azure Portal
2. Figure out Lecture Videos (in progress)
3. Go over CI/CD
4. Web App Demonstration
  - I will assign a short lab-thing
5. More Notes on other Azure Services
6. Study/Work on Assignment

## The Future:
1. Assignment: Create a web app and host it using Azure Web App Service. Just email me the link to the website and I can check it off (rory.eiffe@revature.com)
  - Include a custom message
  - Inspiration: https://github.com/roryeiffe/web-app-2-2024
2. Study notes/resources online and look at practice questions.
